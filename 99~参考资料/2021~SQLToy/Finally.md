# Conclusion

Congratulations! If you made it this far you should have a much better understanding of SQL than when you started!

I spent many years as a software developer with a very inadequate understanding of SQL even though I used it in my jobs. Databases seemed like a magical box which could be convinced maybe with a lot of trial and error to do what I wanted. After learning the SQL Order of Operations and the basics of the relational model I had a breakthrough moment where SQL started to make sense to me. I hope this project has been similarly helpful to those who read it.

If you have questions or comments you can open a GitHub issue or even a pull request.

Thanks for reading!
